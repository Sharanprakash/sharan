    gcloud auth activate-service-account - authorize access to Google Cloud
        with a service account

[m[1mSYNOPSIS[m
    [1mgcloud auth activate-service-account[m [[4mACCOUNT[m] [1m--key-file[m=[4mKEY_FILE[m
        [[1m--password-file[m=[4mPASSWORD_FILE[m | [1m--prompt-for-password[m]
        [[4mGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    To allow [1mgcloud[m (and other tools in Google Cloud CLI) to use service
    account credentials to make requests, use this command to import these
    credentials from a file that contains a private authorization key, and
    activate them for use in [1mgcloud[m. gcloud auth activate-service-account
    serves the same function as [1mgcloud auth login[m but uses a service account
    rather than Google user credentials.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

    [4mKey File[m

    To obtain the key file for this command, use either the Google Cloud
    Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) or [1mgcloud iam service-accounts
    keys create[m. The key file can be .json (preferred) or .p12 (legacy) format.
    In the case of legacy .p12 files, a separate password might be required and
    is displayed in the Console when you create the key.

    [4mCredentials[m

    Credentials will also be activated (similar to running [1mgcloud config set
    account [ACCOUNT_NAME][m).

    If a project is specified using the [1m--project[m flag, the project is set in
    active configuration, which is the same as running [1mgcloud config set
    project [PROJECT_NAME][m. Any previously active credentials, will be retained
    (though no longer default) and can be displayed by running [1mgcloud auth
    list[m.

    If you want to delete previous credentials, see [1mgcloud auth revoke[m.

    [4mNote:[m Service accounts use client quotas for tracking usage.

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To authorize [1mgcloud[m to access Google Cloud using an existing service
    account while also specifying a project, run:

        $ gcloud auth activate-service-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT@DOMAIN.COM \
        --key-file=/path/key.json --project=PROJECT_ID

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [[4mACCOUNT[m]
        E-mail address of the service account.

[m[1mREQUIRED FLAGS[m
     [1m--key-file[m=[4mKEY_FILE[m
        Path to the private key file.

[m[1mOPTIONAL FLAGS[m
     At most one of these can be specified:

       [1m--password-file[m=[4mPASSWORD_FILE[m
          Path to a file containing the password for the service account
          private key (only for a .p12 file).

       [1m--prompt-for-password[m
          Prompt for the password for the service account private key (only for
          a .p12 file).
